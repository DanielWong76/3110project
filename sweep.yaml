  Our project is a replication of the popular game minesweeper. This a game in which you are
  given a field of squares and each square may or may not contain a mine. We have functionality
  that allows for a player to play a game of minesweeper by choosing which square they would
  like to sweep or flag as dangerous. Our game has support for different difficulties based on
  the experience of a player. Our Mine Sweeper is a fun interactive experience!
